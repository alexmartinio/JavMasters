# JavMasters
Java based dice rolling game, loosely based on dicemasters

The player will have apool of health which they will attempt to deplete by collecting and building their dice.

My initial plan is to set up a player object, which will have a health pool and a collection of dice.
I will then go forward in creating various dice collections which will represent states of play and work on the impact of the dice in those collections.
